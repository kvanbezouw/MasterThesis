# MasterThesis
/circuit_control:
Built a Graphical User Interphase (GUI) that allowed for the control of a fibre-optics circuit (which included a laser, data acquisition devices, attenuators etc.), for data gathering and minor data post-processing. It allowed live data acquisition and the automation of measurement routines.
Scripts made in Python.

/data_analysis:
Contains files that analyse Scanning Electron Microscope images, and some of the measurements that were made with the GUI.
Scripts made in MATLAB.
