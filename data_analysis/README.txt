Data analyis;
SEM_surface_roughness contains a script to analyse a black and white topview image of the edge of a surface. The goal is to extract
parameters that quantify the roughness.
General_analysis_file contains a script that analysis transmission spectra taken of optomechanical microdisk resonators. The goal is to extract material and geometry parameters s.a. non-linear absorption coefficients.
